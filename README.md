This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Tcl programming related to the usage of `elseif` within a `proc` (procedure) and provides a corrected version using the `switch` statement. The original code incorrectly uses `elseif`, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution offers a more efficient and readable approach using the `switch` statement to handle multiple conditions.
